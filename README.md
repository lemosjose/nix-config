## Organization 

#### Home
Stores configurations related to home manager, programs, shell stuff and everything that can and should be configured in home-manager 

#### hosts

Store system-level configurations. The config is modularized to make the editing and reading easier and changes are made more softly


## Acknowledgements

 - Thanks to Misterio77 for the configuration examples! This config is basically my basic knowledge of nix ++ his configuration way or organizing files. I also installed nixOS with his starter-configs like lots of Nix users.
